# Add Two Numbers Problem Tutorial (LeetCode)

## 1. Problem Statement
Given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each node contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

- Each input list represents a number in reverse order.
- Each node contains a single digit.
- Return the result as a linked list in reverse order.

## 2. Analyze Inputs and Outputs

### Inputs
- `l1`: First linked list (e.g., 2 → 4 → 3 represents 342)
- `l2`: Second linked list (e.g., 5 → 6 → 4 represents 465)

### Outputs
- A linked list representing the sum (e.g., 7 → 0 → 8 represents 807)

### Example
Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807

## 3. What Should You Do?

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Each list node is a digit, stored in reverse order.
   - You need to add corresponding digits, handling carry.

2. **Think About Approaches:**
   - Traverse both lists simultaneously.
   - Add digits and carry, create new nodes for result.
   - If one list is shorter, treat missing digits as 0.

3. **Write Pseudocode:**
   - Helps clarify your logic before coding.

4. **Implement the Solution:**
   - Use a dummy head for the result list.
   - Traverse both lists, add digits, handle carry.
   - At the end, if carry remains, add a new node.

5. **Test Your Code:**
   - Use sample and edge cases.

6. **Analyze Complexity:**
   - Time Complexity: O(max(m, n)), where m and n are lengths of the lists.
   - Space Complexity: O(max(m, n))

## 4. How Should You Think? (Improving Programming Skills)

- **Break Down the Problem:**
  - What are the inputs? What is the output?
  - Can you solve it by hand for small examples?

- **Start Simple:**
  - Write the most basic solution first.
  - Understand why it works and why it is slow.

- **Look for Patterns:**
  - Is there a way to avoid repeated work?
  - Can you use extra space (dummy node) to simplify code?

- **Practice Writing Pseudocode:**
  - This helps you organize your thoughts and spot mistakes early.

- **Test Thoroughly:**
  - Try different cases: lists of different lengths, carry at the end, all zeros.

- **Reflect on Efficiency:**
  - How does your solution scale as input size grows?
  - Can you improve it?

- **Learn from Others:**
  - Read other solutions and explanations.
  - Try to re-implement them yourself.

## 5. Step-by-Step Solution

### Step 1: Initialize
- Create a dummy head node for the result list.
- Set a pointer `current` to dummy head.
- Set `carry` to 0.

### Step 2: Traverse Lists
- While either list has nodes or carry is non-zero:
  - Get value from each list (0 if list is done).
  - Add values and carry.
  - Set `current->next` to new node with digit (sum % 10).
  - Update carry (sum / 10).
  - Move pointers forward.

### Step 3: Return Result
- Return `dummyHead->next` as the result list.

#### Example Walkthrough
```
l1: 2 → 4 → 3
l2: 5 → 6 → 4
Step-by-step:
2+5=7, carry=0 → 7
4+6=10, carry=1 → 0
3+4+1=8, carry=0 → 8
Result: 7 → 0 → 8
```

## 6. C Implementation Tips
- Define a `ListNode` struct.
- Use a dummy head to simplify code.
- Handle memory allocation for new nodes.
- Free memory if needed.

---

## 7. Edge Cases
- Lists of different lengths.
- Carry at the end (e.g., 5+5=10).
- All zeros.
- Empty lists (should not happen per constraints).

---

## 8. Summary
- Traverse both lists, add digits and carry.
- Use dummy head for result list.
- Handle carry at the end.

---

## 9. Practice and Skill Improvement
- Try with different inputs.
- Implement and test your code.
- Read and understand other people's solutions.
- Reflect on what you learned and how you can apply it to other problems.
